<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Create two virtual machines in Azure; one named DC-1 and Client 1
- Ensure Connectivity between DC-1 and Client 1
- Install Active Directory
- Create an Admin and Normal User account in AD
- Join Client 1 to the domain (mydomain.com)
- Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users (domain users) on Client 1

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- In this screenshot, I chaged the "Domain Controller" virtual machine's NIC Private IP address to static so the IP address won't ever change regardless of any external factors.

- In the first screenshot shows that I have created two virtual machines in Azure; one being the Domain Controller and the other one named Client 1 which is essentially the desktop of a domain user that I will generate later. The second one shows that I have connected to both virtual machines via remote desktop by using thier IP addresses. I displayed their hostnames using the command prompt app.

- On the Domain Controller desktop, I used Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security to enable ICMPv4 rules to ensure the connectivity between Client 1 and Domain Controller servers.

- The first screenshot shows me using Server Manager on the Domain controller's desktop to install Active Directory. The next screenshot shows me promoting Active Directory to a domain controller.

- Now that I've installed Active Directory, I created two Oraganizational units, one named _EMPLOYEES and the other named _ADMINS. I also created my first admin user, Jane Doe. I created her username and password so she can log into the domain. I also made her a member of Domanin Admins group. Now I can use mydomain.com\jane_admin to log onto the remote desktop and "be" Jane Doe.

- These three screenshots show the process of me joing Client 1's virtual machine to the domain I created on the Domain Controller's virtual machine (mydomain.com). I first have to change Client 1's DNS server to match Domain Controller's. I have to do this because when I constructed Client 1's virtual machine, the vnet randomly assigned it a DNS server which doesn't know what "mydomain.com" is and won't allow Client 1 to join the domain I created. Now that both virtual machines have the same DNS server, Im allowed to make the connection now. I used windows setting to make Client 1 a member of the domain named "mydomain.com".

- Lastly, I granted access to "all domain users" which allows them to log on with any computer that is associated with mydomain.com. The second screenshot shows me using Powershell ISE to run a script that automatically generated 10,000 users. Each one of these users can log onto the domain I created with their username and "Password1"
